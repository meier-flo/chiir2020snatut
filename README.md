## Overview
This tutorial will teach you about Social Network Analysis (SNA) and how to do it. We begin by looking at the connection between SNA and the fields of information behaviour and interactive information retrieval. After an introduction to the basics of networks, we will get an overview of how to do social network analysis.  First, look at tools one can use to visualise and analyse networks. After that, we take a deep dive into Gephi, one of the most popular open-source software for SNA. Then, through a mix of theoretical input and practical exercises, we will learn about two ways of doing SNA: visual and metric-based network analysis. Furthermore, we will cover some advanced topics like community detection. Finally, we will have a quick look at how to collect SNA data and brainstorm how you could apply SNA in your research.

## Learning objectives
- Learn about the connections between SNA and research in IB and IIR
- Learn about the basics of networks
- Understand the different types of SNA and what kind of research question(s) they answer
    * Learn about visual network analysis 
    * Learn about metric-based network analysis 
- Gain practical experience in visualizing and analysing networks using Gephi
- Learn about the broad range of possible applications of SNA


## How to prepare for the tutorial

We will be working with the most recent version of the open-source SNA software Gephi. [You can download and install Gephi from here](https://gephi.org/).
Some of you (especially Windows users) might encounter a `Cannot find Java 1.8 or higher` error when trying to run Gephi for the first time. To troubleshoot this problem, three things must be in place:
1. JAVA must be installed on your computer.
2. The PATH system variable for JAVA must be set. [Follow the instructions here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).
3. The `gephi.conf` file must contain the JAVA path. [Follow the instructions here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWQWjx6Ot1E). In case you need more guidance, [this discussion can be helpful.](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/issues/1787)

After you successfully downloaded and installed Gephi, I recommend to follow along this [Simple Gephi Project from A to Z](https://seinecle.github.io/gephi-tutorials/generated-html/simple-project-from-a-to-z-en.html). 
You can also watch and follow along with the updated [video tutorial on Gephi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=371n3Ye9vVo) by Dr Jen Golbeck.

## Instructor
[Dr Florian Meier](https://vbn.aau.dk/da/persons/142274/) is an Assistant Professor in Information Studies in the Department of Communication and Psychology at Aalborg University Copenhagen in Denmark. In 2018, he received a PhD from the University of Regensburg for investigating motivations for and strategies of re-finding Tweets on the social media platform Twitter. Dr Meier's current research focuses on the intersection of information behaviour, computational social science and digital humanities. In his research projects, he applies a variety of research methods including quantitative, qualitative and mixed-method forms of data collection and analysis. In a recent publication, he (re)-introduced the idea of a three-actor model of information sharing, as well as methods of social network analysis to the information behaviour discourse. He has extensive experience in teaching data analysis methods having taught classes introducing social network analysis as an analysis tool both at the University of Regensburg and at Aalborg University Copenhagen.
